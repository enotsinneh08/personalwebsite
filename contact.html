<p>Hello and welcome! I’m Emily Notsinneh, a dedicated storyteller, communicator, and lifelong learner passionate about connecting people through words and ideas. I’m currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree in journalism and communication with a focus on Strategic Communication at the University of New Mexico, while also completing a minor through UNM’s Honors College. Additionally, I have an associates degree in computer information systems from CNM. My academic journey reflects my commitment to creativity and advocacy, and I plan to continue this path by earning a master’s in creative writing at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe.
</p>
<p>Beyond academics, I bring over five years of experience in customer service and leadership roles, as well as a strong background in photography and freelance work. I’m deeply rooted in my Mescalero Apache heritage and actively work to preserve cultural traditions through writing, research, and community involvement. Whether I’m crafting stories, organizing projects, or volunteering, my goal is always to inspire, inform, and empower others.  </p>
<p>If you’d like to collaborate, share ideas, or simply connect, I’d love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out using one of my forms of contact below or through my social media links. Thank you for visiting, I look forward to building meaningful connections and creating something impactful together!  </p>
