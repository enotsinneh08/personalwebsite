<p></p>
<p>I am an undergraduate student at the University of New Mexico, pursuing a bachelor’s degree in journalism and communication with a minor in UNM’s Honors College. My academic journey began with an interest in Desktop Publishing when I was in high school which shortly afterward led to an associate’s degree in computer information systems from Central New Mexico Community College in 2013, where I developed a strong foundation in technology and creative design. During that time, I gained hands-on experience in graphic design, digital media, and web technologies, which taught me how to combine technical skills with visual storytelling.
</p>
<p>Today, I am passionate about using my background in technology to enhance my work in journalism and communication. My goal is to create content that is not only informative but also visually engaging and accessible across multiple platforms. I enjoy exploring how design principles can elevate written narratives and how digital tools can help share stories in innovative ways.
  Beyond academics, I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. I value creativity, adaptability, and collaboration which are skills that have guided me through diverse experiences in customer service, freelance photography, and community involvement. </p>
<p>Looking ahead, I aspire to teach at the college level, sharing my knowledge and inspiring future generations of writers and communicators. Additionally, I plan to pursue a Master’s degree in Creative Writing, with the goal of publishing original works that reflect cultural identity and personal storytelling. By merging technology, journalism, and creative writing, I hope to make a meaningful impact in both education and media. </p>
