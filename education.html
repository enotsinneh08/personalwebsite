	    <p>My educational journey began at Eldorado High School, where I graduated in 2010. Immediately after, I enrolled at Central New Mexico Community College (CNM), pursuing an Associate’s degree in Computer Information Systems, which I completed in 2013. This program gave me a strong foundation in technology and problem-solving, skills that have remained valuable throughout my academic and professional experiences.	      </p>
	    <p>After earning my associate degree, I took a nine-year break from formal education to focus on family, work, and personal growth. During this time, I gained extensive experience in customer service and leadership roles, while also homeschooling my children and engaging in community activities. These years away from school strengthened my resilience, adaptability, and time management skills which are qualities that have been essential in my return to higher education.
	      In 2022, I resumed my academic journey at the University of New Mexico (UNM), where I am currently completing a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism and Communication, with a minor in Honors College. </p>
	    <p>My coursework has deepened my passion for storytelling, media ethics, and cultural preservation, aligning with my long-term goal of amplifying Native voices through creative writing.
	      I am on track to graduate in Spring 2026 and plan to continue my education at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), where I will pursue a Master’s degree in Creative Writing. This next step will allow me to combine my technical background, lived experiences, and cultural heritage to create impactful narratives that inspire and educate future generations.</p>
