   <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
   
    <p>Hello and thank you for visiting! This space was created to share my passions, projects, and ideas with you. Here, you’ll find a blend of creativity, culture, and community which are three values that inspire everything I do. Whether you’re here to learn more about my work, explore resources, or simply connect, I’m glad you stopped by.
      I’m currently in my senior year at the University of New Mexico, pursuing a bachelor’s degree in journalism and communication with a minor in UNM’s Honors College. I plan to pursue a masters degree from the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) this upcoming Fall 2026. My academic journey has deepened my love for storytelling and strengthened my commitment to creating meaningful content. Through writing, photography, and thoughtful conversations, I aim to craft work that resonates, informs, and sparks curiosity.      </p>
    <p>This site reflects the richness of my experiences ranging from education and family life to cultural traditions and creative projects. You’ll find sections dedicated to my current work, insights on topics I care about, and updates on what’s next. If you’re interested in collaboration, have questions, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out through the contact page. Your engagement means so much, and I welcome your thoughts and ideas.
      Thank you for being here. I hope this space inspires you, informs you, and maybe even encourages you to share your own story. Let’s connect, learn, and grow together! </p>
